/**
 * The A/B-specific bootloader message structure (4-KiB).
 *
 * We separate A/B boot control metadata from the regular bootloader
 * message struct and keep it here. Everything that's A/B-specific
 * stays after struct bootloader_message, which belongs to the vendor
 * space of /misc partition. Also, the A/B-specific contents should be
 * managed by the A/B-bootloader or boot control HAL.
 *
 * The slot_suffix field is used for A/B implementations where the
 * bootloader does not set the androidboot.ro.boot.slot_suffix kernel
 * commandline parameter. This is used by fs_mgr to mount /system and
 * other partitions with the slotselect flag set in fstab. A/B
 * implementations are free to use all 32 bytes and may store private
 * data past the first NUL-byte in this field. It is encouraged, but
 * not mandatory, to use 'struct bootloader_control' described below.
 *
 * The update_channel field is used to store the Omaha update channel
 * if update_engine is compiled with Omaha support.
